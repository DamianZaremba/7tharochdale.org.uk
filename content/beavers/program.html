title: Beavers - Program
---

<p>The Programme of activities undertaken by the Colony is designed to help the Beavers develop as individuals. The Beavers' start work on these zones when they first attend a Colony meeting. The activities together help the Beaver earn their badges, to be worn with pride, on their uniforms.</p>

<p>The programme zones are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Exploring The World Around Us.</li>
		<li>Learning About Yourself.</li>
		<li>Getting To Know Other People.</li>
		<li>Discovering Creativity And Practical Skills.</li>
		<li>Discovering Beliefs And Attitudes.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The Beaver Scouts can gain any number of the Activity Badges, the staged Activity Badges (Available to all sections), the Group Awards (Gained throughout the Scout Group) and the Challenge Badges. In addition, the Beaver Scout can qualify for the Chief Scouts Bronze Award.</p>

<p>In addition, a Joining In Badge is presented on the anniversary of the Beaver Scout first joining the movement, one badge every year, in all sections until they move on from the Scout Troop at 14 years old!</p>

<p>The last badge in the series is the Moving On award. It fosters links with the Cub Scout Pack, whilst allowing the Beaver Scout to complete the membership award of the Cub Scout Section. They will undertake this badge when they have reached 8 years old.</p>
