---

<p>
	Badges are split into 5 categories;
</p>

<h3>Core</h3>
<p>These badges are obtained on joining the movement, moving betwean units or for length of time spend in scouts.</p>

<h3>Activity</h3>
<p>These badges are obtained by completing a set of requirements in a specific field.</p>

<h3>Staged</h3>
<p>These badges are like activity badges but have multiple levels so a younger member with more experience might possess a higher level than their older counterpart. </p>

<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>These badges aim for you to work in partnership with another group or external organization in order to achieve the badges.</p>

<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>Awards are achieved by trying new things and learning skills, these connect in with external awards such as DofE.</p>
