<p>Beavers meets on Wednesday evenings; 6:30pm until 7:30pm.</p>

<p>The Colony is made up of a number of lodges, named after monkeys. The Beaver Scouts may change Lodges whilst they are in our colony. The Beaver Scouts take part in an active &amp; structured programme, including indoor &amp; outdoor activities. The BSL &amp; the leadership team plan the programme.</p>

<p>Our Beaver Scout colony is co-educational and meets on a Wednesday, we provide a wide variety of activities, including outdoor activities, adventurous activities, indoor craftwork, interesting local visits and most importantly fun! The meetings generally start with a game and proceed through a teaching activity again with the emphasis on fun; it's much easier to use a game situation to teach scouting skills.</p>

<p>The meeting will usually close with another short game and any announcements, hopefully everyone goes home happy and tired, the leaders do!! The sort of things we teach are simple outdoor skills, craftwork and the list goes on. There are community visits to places of worship, interesting local places like the planetarium and local facilities such as the fire station and police station. There are visits and talks from local organisations such as the Salvation Army, the RSPCA and Three Owls Bird Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Additionally, the meeting overlaps with the Cub Scout Pack for 15 minutes, to allow the Beavers to get to know the Cubs, prior to moving up. Once 8, the Beaver moves onto <a href="{{ site.basedomain }}/cubs/">Cubs</a>.</p>
