<p>The Programme of activities undertaken by the Pack is designed to help the Cubs develop as individuals. The Cubs' start work on these zones when they first attend a Pack meeting. The activities together help the Cubs to earn their badges, to be worn, as many Cubs before, with pride, on their uniforms.</p>

<p>The programme zones are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Outdoor Scouting.</li>
		<li>Fitness.</li>
		<li>Discovering The World Around You.</li>
		<li>Creative.</li>
		<li>Beliefs And Attitudes.</li>
		<li>Caring And Community.</li>
		<li>Global.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The Cub Scouts can gain any number of the Activity Badges, the staged Activity Badges (Available to all sections), the Group Awards (Gained throughout the Scout Group) and the Challenge Badges. In addition, the Cub Scout can qualify for the Chief Scouts Silver Award.</p>

<p>In addition, a Joining In Badge is presented on the anniversary of the Cub Scout first joining the movement, one badge every year, in all sections until they move on from the Scout Troop at 14 years old!</p>

<p>The last badge in the series is the Moving On award. It fosters links with the Scout Troop, whilst allowing the Cub Scout to complete the membership award of the Scout Section. They will undertake this badge when they reach 10 years old, or a little older.</p>
