<p>Cubs meet on a Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>A Pack is made up of up to six Sixes, two at present, named after colours (Yellow, Blue, White &amp; Green etc). The sixes are a group of up to six Cubs, lead by a Sixer &amp; a Seconder. The Cubs take part in a varied programme, including outdoor, adventurous activities, &amp; indoor craftwork. The programme is planned by the CSL, after consultation with the Pack Council.</p>

<p>Our Cub Scout pack is co-educational. We provide a wide variety of activities, including outdoor activities, adventurous activities, indoor craftwork, interesting local visits and most importantly fun! The meetings generally start with a game and proceed through a teaching activity again with the emphasis on fun; it's much easier to use a game situation to teach scouting skills.</p>

<p>The meeting will usually close with another short game and any announcements, hopefully everyone goes home happy and tired, the leaders do!! The sort of things we teach are tracking, simple navigation, backwoods cooking, camping, hiking and the list goes on. There are community visits to places of worship, interesting local places like the planetarium and local facilities such as the fire station and police station. There are visits and talks from local organisations such as the Salvation Army, the RSPCA and Three Owls Bird Sanctuary.</p>

<p>While the Cubs are completing the Challenge Badges, they can also gain Activity Badges &amp; Staged Activity Badges. These badges are for the Cub to develop their own hobbies &amp; interests. They give the Cub something to be proud of. Some of these badges are gained at Pack nights, some at home, &amp; some on trips out.</p>

<p>Additionally, the meeting overlaps with the Beaver scout colony for 15
minutes, to allow the Beavers to get to know the Cubs, prior to moving up. Once 10&frac12;, the Cubs move onto the <a href="{{ site.basedomain }}/scouts/">Scout troup</a>.</p>
