We recently held our annual general meeting, at our HQ, as usual.

Before we started the meeting, Stephen Allen, the DC, presented another long service award, to Mrs G Foster, our Group Chairman. This is yet another example of how our helpers put in many years of service to Scouting. Well-done Mrs Foster!
 
After the reports from our three section leaders, telling the parents present what the Beavers, Cubs & Scouts have been getting up to over the past year, we elected our officers of the executive committee, for the next year: 
* Chairman - Mrs G Foster.
* Secretary - Mr A Pemberton.
* Treasurer - Mr P Downes.
 
Mike expressed his thanks to all the retiring committee, before they were re-appointed for another year!
Sadly, Mr Mills was unable to carry on as treasurer this year. Thanks anyway, you have been a big support to us all.
