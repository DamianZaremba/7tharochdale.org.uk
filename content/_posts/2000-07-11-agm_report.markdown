7thA held their AGM at the group HQ, on Tuesday 11th July.
At this meeting we had short reports from both the Cubs & the Scouts, along with Mike's review of the year.

Cub Scout highlights include the following;
* Cub day - Parents took their children and they got the opportunity to take part in lots of different activities including the water slide and assaults course. 
* Some of the Cubs attended Sports day and achieved their Athletes Badge. 
* We entered the swimming gala for the first time in a few years, with a mixed team. The Cubs enjoyed themselves. 
* A trip to Roller city was a very well attended. Cubs from all over the District took over the skating rink. They went round in groups and spent time roller skating, playing in the adventure area and having something to eat. I must thank Sam Kennedy for here help that night, and on other Cub events. 
* Sixer's day was held at Balderstone School. The cubs went round several bases with a scouting theme and they had a go on the climbing wall. The Cubs that attended enjoyed this event. 
* Lastly the Millennium Camp, held at Ashworth Valley. This went well as most of the Cubs who went had never camped before, it was a new experience for most of them. 

The Scout troop highlights are below;
* Both the Troop & the Pack attended the County "North 2000," Millennium Camp, held at Ashworth Valley, over the late May bank Holiday weekend. This was one of many such camps held all over the UK. 
* We held an Activity Weekend at the end of March. Based at the Club Room, quite a few of the Scouts took part, with the weekend finishing with two teams entering the "Darlington Hike" competition. 
* The Troop held an interesting meeting at the "Curtain Theatre," organised by Mr Montgomery, our thanks go to Adrian for this. Of course, we try to get out & about as much as possible in the warm evenings. 
* Last autumn, the Troop invited the Scouts from 27/15th to join them in The Fire Safety badge course. All of the Scouts that took part completed the course, & gained the badge. 

Mike thanked the retiring committee for their help & support over the last year.
The new members of the committee were then elected as follows; 
* Chairman - Mrs Foster.
* Treasurer - Mr Mills.
* Secretary - Mr Pemberton.

Committee members;
* Mrs Hindle
* Mrs Scott
* Mr King
* Mrs Whitam
* Mrs MacKinnon. 

Stephen Allan, from Rochdale District, called to present Long Service awards to Mrs Hindle & Mrs Scott.
These are for the recognition of 15 or more year's service to the movement, a very notable achievement I am sure.
