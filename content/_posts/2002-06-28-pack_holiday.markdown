June 28th, saw 7th A Rochdale Cub Scouts going off to Bowley campsite for the weekend.
They stayed in the Lodge with pitched some tents outside. The theme for the Weekend was the tales of "Harry Potter", The Pack was sorted into sixes, as called out by the famous sorting (baseball) hat. After a stroll around the campsite, and down into the valley, the Cubs went to set up for the first night, with the girls sleeping indoors, and the boys sleeping in the tents, outside.
 
The next morning, after what seemed like only two hours sleep (I suppose it might have been three), the girls were rudely awakened by the boys outside their window, shouting out and telling us they were hungry (What do we want, we want GRUB!) Once everyone was up the first activities of the day started. These were climbing, grass sledging and archery. Some of the younger girls can climb like monkeys & shoot arrows like Robin Hood (Akela shoots like a monkey and climbs like Robin Hood). After lunch there were bases working around potions run by Snape (Akela), charms run by me, Hedwig, and transfiguration run by Dumbledore (Mike). Then, after watching some people playing war games. It was time for the campfire sing along, without any fire, inside the sports hall. After a long night singing the girls retired to the tents, where they proceeded to scare themselves with ghost stories, until they eventually returned indoors. The next morning we played games, and carried out some challenges, until after lunch, when everyone packed up and eventually went home.
 
Every one on the Harry Potter weekend had a spell binding time, much thanks to Akela for putting on such a great Pack Holiday.
