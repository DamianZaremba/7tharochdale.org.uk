On the first weekend of half term 7th A Scouts held an activity weekend.  The team consisted of five Scouts and one Cub.

It all started on the Friday at 7:15 in the evening when the flag went up for the whole weekend and not just for a few hours on a Thursday or Wednesday night. Everyone was welcomed and notices were read out.
We then had a chance to get changed. We had a game of none stop cricket and burnt off some energy. Then all the Scouts that were not staying were dismissed. Soon it was time for supper and us six all got hot chocolate & a biscuit, yummy!
At 11:30 it was time for bed but not sleep and most Scouts stayed awake till all hours.

At 6:30 the next morning another Scout and I arose from our beds to do a Saturday paper round. The cooks got another hours sleep and everyone else didn't have to wake up till 7:50am.
Breakfast was later then planed because Akela fell asleep. But we finally ate and loved every spoon of porridge that we had. Once the information arrived about princess Margaret the flag was put to half-mast and we all saluted.

After that we strained ourselves to get the tents from the loft and started to pitch them inside.
We did two tents per team before we could even think about lunch.
At 1:15 we departed for Blackburn arena to try ourselves at the horrors of ice-skating.
As most Scouts managed to get round for four whole hours without falling down with the exception of Akela who did a classic back flip onto the bum.
When we got back we had dinner with cake and sandwiches. Once we had destroyed that we did some test work and had a wide game cut short by a heavy breathing Scout!
We then ordered a chippy supper and settled down in the back room. We had a game of cards and our chips arrived and we got tucked in.
Then we mucked around and started tuning into radio stations and wap sites and phoning our friends to find out who won pop idol.
After all the excitement of the day we all slept like logs, only to be awaken the next morning for breakfast.
After breakfast we started a pioneering project and what started life as a message board ended life as a squirrel catcher being demonstrated by having cuddlely toys hurled at it.
At lunch we had whatever food was left. Once that was over every one went on a trust exercise. Some of the sites we saw included a Shetland pony, a burnt out car and a very muddy field.
Once we got back we swept up, tidied away our stuff and went to flag down. We were all tired, cold, wet and dirty. We all rejoiced when our parents arrived.
I can sum the whole weekend up in one word Excellent. And thanks to Mike Phillips, the GSL. We hope to have another weekend like this very soon.

All the leaders need a big thank you for making this weekend possible and I think every one who went on the activity weekend will back me up on that.
