title: Scouts - Program
---

<p>The programme of activities undertaken by the Troop is designed to help the Scouts develop as individuals. The Scouts' start work on these zones when they first attend a Troop meeting. The activities together help the Scouts' to earn their badges, to be worn, with pride, on their uniforms, as many Scouts have done before.</p>

TODO - fix the css for rendering this program list, it's not bulletpointed atm

<p>The programme zones are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Scoutcraft And Adventure.</li>
		<li>Global.</li>
		<li>Community.</li>
		<li>Fit For Life.</li>
		<li>Exploring Beliefs And Attitudes.</li>
		<li>Creative Expression.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The Scouts can gain any number of the Activity Badges, the staged Activity Badges (Available to all sections), the Group Awards (Gained throughout the Scout Group) and the Challenge Badges. In addition, the Scout can qualify for the Chief Scouts Gold Award.</p>

<p>In addition, a Participation Badge is presented on the anniversary of the Scout first joining the movement, one badge every year, until they move on from the Scout Troop at 14 years old.</p>

<p>The last badge in the series is the Moving On award. It fosters links with the Local Explorer Scout Unit, whilst allowing the Scout to complete the membership award of the Explorer Scout Unit. They will undertake this badge when they reach 14 years old, or whereabouts'.</p>

<p>At the Age of 14 the Scout will move on to the <a href="{{ site.basedomain }}/explorers/">Explorer Scout Unit</a>. When they have completed their Sectional career, we hope that they will continue to help with the new members in the future, both as active Explorer Scouts, &amp; as Young Leaders. At present, we have started to host the Unit, for our active Explorer Scouts. They meet once a month, as well as helping out with our junior sections.</p>
