<p>Scouts meet on a Thursday Evening.</p>

<p>Our Scout Troop is a co-educational Troop. The patrols in our Troop are named after birds and animals. Currently there are the Stag Patrol &amp; the Wolf Patrol.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of activities for the scouts to enjoy, and don't imagine it's all hard work and serious training. There are outdoor training activities such as survival skills, camping, cooking and navigation exercises.</p>

<p>There are indoor training evenings where the scouts learn basic Scouting skills, the theory of outdoor skills and practice handling equipment used for the outdoor and adventurous activities. There are adventurous activities including canoeing, climbing, hiking and camping where the scouts can build on the skills learnt in previous training sessions. The rest of the programme is made up of interesting local visits where the Scouts will visit a local facility or landmark and learn about it's role or place in the community, we also have visitors to give talks on various subjects.</p>

<p>All the activities, even the training is planned with enjoyment in mind, if you enjoy something you learn it! The emphasis is on outdoor activity let's put the out in scouting!</p>

<p>Once 14&frac12;, the Scouts have an option of becoming young leaders and helping the leadership team to run the meetings.</p>
