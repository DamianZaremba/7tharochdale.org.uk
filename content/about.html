<p>Hi, and welcome to the Group History page of 7thA Rochdale Scout Group.

<p>The group was established in 1943, 7th of December to be exact as a part of the Sunday school at Spotland Methodist
Church. It was originally formed as a Wolf Cub pack and was sponsored by the church, this sponsorship continues to
the present day.</p>

<p>The group originally met in the chapel buildings, before moving to an upstairs room just off Mitchell Street. The
group made another move to the current location when the headquarters at Spotland Bridge were built by the members
and opened in the autumn of 1962. In the boom times of the early 80's an extension was built to accommodate the
increased numbers. Sadly the numbers declined in the 90's and the extension had to be closed. The actual building was
sold on to another Scout Group.</p>

<p>During the history of the group all of the sections Beavers, Cubs, and Scouts, along with the older, no longer
existing sections of Ventures', and Seniors', have been active at some time. The group currently has the three
active sections. These are a Beaver Scout Colony, a Cub Scout Pack and a Scout Troop. In addition, we are co-hosts of
Rochdaleâ€™s first Explorer Scout Unit, the Pioneers. The Pioneers meet at our HQ every other week. We alternate the
meetings with our friends at Dernley, the 29thA.</p>

<p>The group was the first in Rochdale to go co-educational when five female Scouts and one female Cub Scout were
invested into the group in October 1999. This investiture took place at a special open evening for parents, which was
attended by Ian Kay the District Commissioner. Ian was of course a 7thA Scout himself, before being
&quote;promoted&quote; to these giddy heights, in 1991. </p>

<p>This short history brings us up to the present day, we have recently celebrated our 60th anniversary in 2003,
with a special service at Spotland Methodist Church. </p>

<p>If you have any information or anecdotes to add to this history please e-mail them to me, the Web Master, you can
also speak to our GSL on 01706 352659.</p>
